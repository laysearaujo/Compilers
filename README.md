# Compilers

Welcome to the Compilers repository! This repository is dedicated to the study and development of compilers. Compilers are essential tools that translate high-level programming languages into machine code, making them a crucial part of modern software development.

## About

This repository serves as a resource for anyone interested in learning about compilers, whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer. Here you will find:

- Lexer and Parser implementations
- Scope analysis tools
- Documentation and tutorials on compiler design and development
- And more!

## Features

- **Lexer**: The lexer component of a compiler, responsible for tokenizing the input source code.
- **Parser**: The parser component that builds the abstract syntax tree (AST) from the tokens generated by the lexer.
- **Scope Analysis**: Tools and code related to scope analysis in compilers.
- **ANTLR-Python**: Examples and code related to the ANTLR parser generator for Python.nd:
